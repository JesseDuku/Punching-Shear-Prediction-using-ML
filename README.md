# Punching-Shear-Prediction-using-ML
# Project Overview
This project developed a machine learning model to predict the punching shear capacity of concrete slabs. Punching shear is a common failure mode in concrete structures where concentrated forces cause localized failure zones. Accurately estimating the punching shear capacity is essential for safe structural design.

Traditional analytical methods for calculating punching shear capacity have limitations. This project aimed to demonstrate the potential of using machine learning techniques as an alternative approach.
# Methods
This machine learning algorithm was used for this project
Support vector regression (SVR)
# Conclusions
The machine learning model demonstrated promising accuracy and generalization ability in predicting the punching shear capacity compared to traditional analytical methods. With further refinement, this approach could provide an alternative tool for design engineers to rapidly estimate punching shear in concrete structures.
